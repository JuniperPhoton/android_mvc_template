# Android MVC template

This simple SMS inbox reader application demonstrates one of the possible approaches to implementation of MVC architectural pattern in Android.

You're invited to clone/fork this repository and use it as a template for your own great apps!

# Fine print

As a matter of fact, the architecture proposed is that of MVP rather than a pure MVC. 

I decided to call it MVC template because I assume that a person looking for Android MVC is looking for a suitable architectural pattern for Android application rather than MVC specifically. Moreover, there is a widespread tendendency to ignore the distinction between MVC and MVP and just call them both MVC.

I apologize for misguiding you if you're seeking for a pure MVC template.
